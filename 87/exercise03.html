     <h2>Computer-Controlled Cutting (Feb. 10)</h1>
    
    <h3>Process</h3>
	<p>
	 Below you will find my dictation, notes and documentation about the processes I went throught with regards to designing and building my project. I primairly used Antimony and Inkscape to design my pieces and the laser cutter to create them. Plus, I used a graphic design software called Canva. A link at the bottom of the page will take you to all of the files that I created for this exercise. For this exercise I created a Batman and Robon kit as well as personalized sticker for my niece.
	</p>
        
    <h3>Antimony</h3>
	<p>I began this process with using Antimony to create a circle with a section cut out of it. I first began looking at the joint.sb file that was provided to use. This was used with some backwards design to create my circles and triangle with sections cut out of it. I first create a 2D circle, 2D rectangle, and a 2D square. Next, I began experiment with creating equaltions in the x and y values of the 2 rectangle I made that would  be tied to my triangle, such as x0.x1/2 in the xo of the rectangle and t0.y1/2 in the rectangle's y0. This took a lot of time and experimentation to get the rectangles to be aligned to the sides of the triangle. Next, I set the width and height to 0.75 and 0.5, and I learend that I need to switch this in my second rectangle. By switch the values in change the direction of the rectanlge with the different axis. I than connected each of the pieces into the difference fucntiona and extrude this shape with a zmax of 0.15. I am still tring to learn how to union or blend the parts together so that they will not move if I move the triangle in different directions outside of up, down, left and right with regards to the sides. You can see this in the image below:  
	</p>
         <p class=pic><img src=media/triangle%20antimony1.png></p>
        
	    <p>From what I learned with the triangle, I tried applying what I learned through creating the triangle shape to make a circle with cut outs. I began this process by creating a 2D circle with a 2D rectangle. I made the rectangles with the same as the previous one in the trianlge cut out at 0.75 and 0.5. I used the array tool that I learned about from the previous exercise and examining the joints.sb file. I than took the array and connected to a difference along with the circle. Lastly, I extruded the zmax to 0.15. You can see this process in the images below:</p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/circleantimony0.png></p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/circle%20antimony1.png></p>
        
<p>I realized something was wrong with the shape. I was not able to control the rectangle with the circle. I wanted them to be connected and change together. I experimented with making connections with the orange wires to different x and y points, but made no progress except for making my work worse. I made sure to save a orginal copy before experiementing. Next, I went back and look at the joint.sb file, which the dicovery of using the radius of the circle to control the y value of the rectangle. This worked, and you can see the change in the image below:</p>
    <p class=pic><img src=media/circleantimony2.png></p>
        
    <p> Finally, I connected the new shape into a copy and made the copy into an array. I was able to control the array's location with the x and y value as well as the size. One of my colleagues and I sat down for about 2 hours to make this come to life. I made multiple copies of my work by saving it as a new version throughout the learning process because I didn't want to screw up my orginal when makign progress as well as I was afraid of losing my work, if Antimony crashed.</p>
        
        <p class=pic><img src=media/circleantimony4.png></p>
        
	<h3>Inkscape</h3>
        <p>For all of my work, I set my document properties to inches and to over all size of my work area to fit my laser cutter as well as I saved each change as a new .svg and PDF documents. I began using Inkscape by creating basic shapes and using the clone tile function under clone in the edit category. I learned about this function from Terence. After being able to create and clone multiple shapes using a parent and child process, this gave me the ability to start a smaller rectangle with the size of 0.155 inches, which I used a caliper to measure the thickness of carboard. I than cloned this rectangle alinged them to the sides of a large rectangle. Finally, I used the difference function to create cut outs in four areas of the large rectangle, and cloned multiples of this rectangle. The problem I ran into with using the difference function was that I could not manipulate the orginal parent rectangle because it was not merged into a new shape.</p>
        
        <p>Next, I tried just over laying a smaller rectangle over the larger rectangle without it using the difference tool. I tested this by turning it into a PDF and looking for an outline that I set to red at 0.001. This allowed me to see that my theory would work as well as I did a test cut on the laser cutter. I experiemented with changing the outline of the small rectangle and the sizes to see if it would change the children from the parent. I than grouped this together using the grouping function, but I learned quickly that you cannot clone the object when it is grouped. I than ungrouped the object and began cloning it. This began to work. I could make changes to the parent and it would change the children clones. The only issue I began to notice was when I would move the clone that was on top of the parent. After practicing and experiement with changes to this process as well as speaking with a colleague, I realized I needed to move the clone on top of the parent to the bottom using the tool under the object area before cloning it. I did not make this change until the next day after I already made some long rectangles that were 8x2 inches with 6 cut out tabs and different sizes squares, which are 2x2 and 4x4 inches. Atleast, I was able to get some shapes made. I also learned that sometimes the children will physically change on the screen, but the values will not change. For example, I noticed this when I changed the stroke line of my parent tab the top tab did not change its value but it did changes it's physical size. Either way it still worked, which was interesting to discover. Finally, I made a polygon. Below are images of this process:</p>
	
           <p class=pic><img src=media/pdf%20of%20layerd%20square.png></p>
           <p class=pic><img src=media/square%20clone%20manipulation.png></p>
           <p class=pic><img src=media/shapes%20inkscape.png></p>
        
    <p>The following day I spoke to Terence about creating interlocking Batman pieces. I used what I leared from the the shapes and applyied it to creating this project. I found a .svg of a Batman logo and imported it into Inkscape as well as I used gride lines to make placement easier, which can be found under document properties. All of my creations were set to a a no fill with a resd stroke line of 0.001, so that it would cut throug.The batman logo was set to 5x3 inches. Next, I began creating rectangles that were 0.155 thick and 0.5 long. I than cloned them and began placing them in different areas of the logo as well as I moved the new child on top of the parent below it, which makes it easier when making changes to the parent shape. I realized that you can use the change by 90 degrees tool to flip the shapes directions. It is important to realize which way you flipped it, because, if you change the parent shape it will make the child move in a direction that it was flipped. For example, I ran it this issue when I flipped my shape the wrong way and when I increased the parent shape it would go outside the batman logo instead of going deeper into it. I than grouped the the rectangles and the batman logo, so I could clone them. After cloning and saving my work, I did a test cut.  </p>
        
          <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20protcut1.png></p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20inkscape1.png></p>
        
        <p>From my first batman design, I noticed the my joints were to loose and the two vertical cuts between the ears and on the tail were destroying the look of the logo. I than made changes to the shape to fix these issues. I change the wide of the rectangle parent to 0.15 from 0.155 as well as I removed the two vertical pieces I described previously. I than laser cut this new version, which I found success with the changes. You can see this in the images below:</p>
        
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20protcut2.png></p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20inskape2.png></p>
                 
    <p> I than began making a joint connector. I made these out of two rectangles that were 2x2 inches as well as I continue with the same cut out tab size. I used the union function to join them.I had to make a change to the depth of the tb due to the wings runnign into each other. I made the </p>
        
         <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20protcut3.png></p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20inkscape3.png></p>
                  
    <p>I than found a robin logo to make as a joint too. I could not find a .svg, so I used a .jpeg. I imported the file and used the trace bitmap function, which provide me with a new functional image. I manipulated the size of the robin logo to 3x3 inches and created tabs that followed the same size as the others. I rotated the rectanlges at an angle and placed them in the robin logo. I grouped the robin logo and cloned it. Finally, I made full page of logos and cut them out. The Batman and Robin joint project took me about 5 hours to complete as well as I spent about another 4 hours on the orginally shape project to gain udnerstanding of the process and tools. The imgages below show the outcome of the Batman and Robin joints:</p>
        
         <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20procut4.png></p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20inkscape4.png></p>
    
            <p>I than assembled the Batman and Robin pieces togther to create a larger Batman logo. In the first image below you can see the large batman logo. The second images has it upside down so you can see the robin logos helping create the large logo.</p>
        
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20and%20robin1.png></p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20and%20robin2.png></p>
        
<p> Lastly, I created an interlocking joint. I modified the orginal joint by making three smaller joints. The first rectangle was used create a smaller distance between the larger square that was 0.15x0.15 inches. Than I made a space equal to the distance of the the first rectangle to another 0.15x0.15 inch square. The second square would provide an interlocking method. I than grouped these three shapes togther as one object. Next, I cloned the the shape and moved them around the batman logo. You can see that in the images below:
    
        <p class=pic><img src=media/batman%20interlocking.png></p>
         <p class=pic><img src=media/interlocking%20batman1.png></p>
        
                 
     <p> I got the <a href="http://icompile.eladkarako.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/batman_logo.svg"></a> batman logo</p> and the <a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7054/6809237850_bb561692b7_b.jpg">robin logo</a> from these links. I used this previous <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.10/people/matt.blackshaw/week2.html"> Matt Blackshaw's Fab Lab site</a> for so inspiration. </p>
      
      <p>The laser cutter is an amazing tool! I enjoyed using it and found that the sky is the limit with regards to creating objects. It is a tool that you need to respect, because, it can set things on fire if not watched and maintenced correctly. I watched a colleague set a piece of cardboard on fire during this seasion by running the laser over and over in a smaller area to create a detailed shap. I know how to take the main mirror a part for cleaning it as well as lubricating the channel that moves the laser back and forth. It is important to have the air compressor and vacuum running to limit the chance of creating a fire. If you do not have the correct settings in your file or on the laser cutter, you can waste materials, destroy your product or create general damage. The image below is my Batman and Robin assembly kit:</p>

    <h3>Vinyl Cutter</h3>
	<p>I created a wall sticker for my niece's first birthday. I used a graphic design software called <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> to create the logo. My wife taught me how to use the software. It is great for creating professional and clean cut designs. The software is very user friendly by allowing you to click, drag and making changes to graphics, predesigned layouts, professional fonts and much more. The software is a free browser-based tool, but it does charge you based on what resoruces you choose to use and export. I feel this would a great tool to use with my students to create custom graphics and designs. Next, I imported the image of the logo as a .png in Inkscape. Canva allows you export documents as PDF an .png files. I then bitmapped the image and scaled it to fit the sizes and parameters of the vinyl cutter as well as make adjustments to the image. After cutting it, I put transfer tape over the sticker so that it can be applied to her bedroom wall. I already learned how to use the vinyl cutter towards the end of last year with regards ot the basics, but I practiced doing test cuts first as well as looking at the differences between cutting from Inkscape, Adobe and the Roland Cutting software. Each Inkscape has the least amount of control because you can only see the sizes. Adobe allows you a preiew view features with controls over sizing and fit. Lastly, I used the Roland Software which provide a lot of control over printing area and location. When I completed a small test sample, I relaized I had multiple layers of the same image from the bitmapping. You will see that in the first image. I made corrections and redid the cut. I got the <a href="https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/313843/screenshots/1640354/final_version_logo_ellie.png"> elephent icon</a> as a part of my design. Below you will find the image from the Canva followed by an image from Inkscape and than an image from the vinyl cut:
	</p>
      <p class=pic><img src=media/bad%20cut1.png></p>
    <p class=pic><img src=media/lily%20canva.png></p>
      <p class=pic><img src=media/lily%20inkscape.png></p>
      <p class=pic><img src=media/lily%20vinyl%20cut.png></p>
      <p>I used the Adobe and Roland Cut Studio softwares to cut my design. The Adobe software allows you to easily change sizes and orientation of the image using its print controls. The Roland Cut Studio software gives you the ability to change the orgin and the scale of the image as well as the orientation. You can even cut directly from Inkscape, but it gives you very little control You can see the this in the images below:</p>
         <p class=pic><img src=media/roland%20cut%20studio1.png></p>
         <p class=pic><img src=media/adobe1.png></p>
         <p class=pic><img src=media/adobe2.png></p>
      
      <p> I used the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i1v__Q-ViU"> Roland Cut Studio video</a> to learn more about the software.  I also watch a two part Roland tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IPzc2YjRS4"> part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm-5GZ0Fp_E"> part 2</a>. This taught me even mroe about how to use the cutter, including changing the standard 45 degree blade to a 60 degree blade for thicker material. You can use the text tool to create text as well as I learned that under preferences you can make a lot of changes to the text, including style, shape, curved surface, color and more. You can also copy and paste jpeg images off the web and paste them into the software. You can also outline the image when you right click on the image and outline the image. This give you the abiloty customeize the image as well as you can double click and change the the nodes of the image. This reminds me of the same tool in InkScape. This give you the ability to add or remove nodes as well as disconnect nodes and make new connections. You can also make custum shapes and intergrate them together. You can them save them under symbol, so you can develop a library and access them later. You can also align objects and center them under the objects at the top. This can align objects vertically, horzientially, between objects and more. You have the ability to merge objects and even create off sets. Under objects you can even mirro objects, which can be helpful if you were putting a stick on the inside of a window.</p>
      
      <p>The vinyl cutter is great for making different stickers, tools for outlines and changing the type of vinyl for different projects. I feel like I can create things with it, but I still get confused about changing the orinetion and the size. I learned how load the vinyl either by roll or sheet as well as use the pressure test for getting the little blade just right for cutting. I still need to figure out how to change the orientation in the Roland Cut Studio. </p>
      
	<h3>Image Formating</h3>
      <p>I used a website to convert png files to jpeg files to use them on the Roland Cut Studio software. Roland uses bitmap and jpeg images.I used<a href="http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg">Online Convert</a> to change the image format. This helped when sending files into Roland Cut Studio. </p>
      
      <h3>Bruce Mau - Fab Academy Recitations</h3>
      
      <p>This was a greta presentation. I found his design philosophy to wonderful. He was very open-minded and provided great insight into how design is affecting all areas of life. The variety of projects he has worked on was amazing and the concepts of design being a part of everything will do is humbling to think about.</p>
