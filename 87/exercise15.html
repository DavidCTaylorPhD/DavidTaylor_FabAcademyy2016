     <h2>Networking and Communication (May 11)</h1>
    
    <h3>Process</h3>
	<p>
        Below you will find my dictation, notes and documentation about the processes I went throught with regards to completing the Networking and Communications exercise. Each of the step and processs will be covered in seperate sections. The goal of this exercise was to be able to create a wire or wireless boards that both have processors and communicate. A link at the bottom of the page will take you to all of the files that I created for this exercise.</p>
	</p>
    
    
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
	<p>
	I began reviewing <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/fagan.terence/wk13.html">Terence's page</a> and <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/harris.adam/week13.html">Adam's page</a> as well as <a/><a href= "http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/hauksdottir.sigridur_helga/W13_networking_and_communications.html">Shelga's page.</a> By reviewing these pages as well as the expectations and notes for this <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/index.html">week's lesson</a>, it helped prepared me for my work.</p>
      
      <p>I decide to use the concept of <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/charlottelatin/students/87/exercise11.html">my photoresistor board</a> from the Input week. I am using a bridge and a node of the board to connect one another to collect data. The concept will focus on having each board having a phototransitor, which will measure the  the amount of light and collect a value based on a threshold, which will show the board that is brighter or dark at a given moment. The data collected from the phototransistor input is sent to the computer, if the value of the threshold of light vs dark is the same one message will appear, but if it is different another message will appear in the serial monitor.</p>
	
      <H3>Eagle and Soldering</H3>
      
     <p> I took my phototransistor board and made adjustments to it in Eagle to create my bridge and node. The first two images are the bridge and the second two images are the node. This was my first attempt at this process.
         
          <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.1.png></p>
       <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.2.png></p>
       <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.3.png></p>
       <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.4.png></p>
      
      <p>After making my boards, I realized that I did not make connections for the TX. I made connections for the TX on for the bridge and the node, which the TX is connected to Pin3 for an analog input. You can see this in the new changes below:</p>
      
        <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.5.png></p>
        <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.7.png></p>
      
      <p>The image below are my first boards. The bridge did not work, so I made another one.</p>
          <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.11.jpg></p>
  <p>The next bridge board I created did work, but as I was taking off the wiring to test to see if it was working, the jumpers connectors ripped off. I stood there and just laughed. I was happy that it worked, but frustrated that it broke. The thought of my design working gave me confidence.</p>
      
      <h3>Coding</h3>
      
      <p> I coded the board using the Arduino IDE. I used the High Low tech tiny45 diagram to help with programming and designing.The image below is my first attempt at coding:</p>

	  <h3>Problems</h3>
	  <p>I cannot get my boards to work. I have made multiples of them and tried trouble shooting them too. I do not have a strong knowledge of this topic, so I believe I am just going down different rabbit holes with no luck or udnerstanding to know what to look for to help me. I am becoming frustrated, so I am going to take a break from this exercise and come back to it at a later date in June.</p>
	  
	  <h4>Starting Over</h4>
	  
	  <p>I decide to start over. I am doing this because it gives me the opportunity to start with a clean slate. Tom has offered to help with this process and work with me. He supported me through this processs.</p>
	  
	  <p>I began this process by using the Arduino IDE to complete the coding. Tom first had me mold this process of networking by doing it with two arduinos. I began this process by using the example code under the section titled <b>Wires</b> in the IDE. I than opened the examples <b>master_writer</b> and <b>slave_reciver</b>. I than upload the master code to a master arduino and the slave code to a slave arduino. I left the slave arduino connected to the USB cord, which was attached to the computer. Next, I began wiring the two arduinos together. I connected the the SCLs together as well as the SDA pins too. Lastly, I connected the GND and the 5V pins of the two boards together.</p>
	  
	  <p>When I opened the serial monitor of the slave code. I recieved values of the 8 pin communicating back and forth with one another. It is important to color code your wires to the pins because it helps with not getting confused. This process was a success. I learned that the built in pull up resistor in the arduino helps bring up the signal after reading the drop. The images below show this process:</p>
	  
	  <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.11.png></p>
	  <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.12.png></p>
	   <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.15.JPG></p>
	  <p class=pic><img src=media/week15.13.png</p>
	 
		  
	<p>Next, I went throught the process of using my Fabduino modified satshakit board as my slave.  The design I am using orginal came from <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/doc/projects/satshakit/satshakit.html">satshatkit</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/satshas/satshakit">satshatkit files</a> were the foundation for the changes I made to my board in Eagle. I changed the reset and added a GND pin based on Ian's design. Ian helped me with this process of creating the Fabduino.</p>
	  
	  <p>I than connected the fabduino to my computer and loaded the <b>slave_recieve</b> sketch to the board. Furthermore, I added a serial write line that would state it is connected ont eh serial monitor. Next, I began connecting the wires from the FTDI to the fabduino slave, which I than connected the other arduino master as well as the fabduino slave to each through a breadboard. I did this due to the fabduino not having a pull up resistor. I connected the SCLs and the SDAs together throught the 5.4 K resistors which was connected to the 5V from the FTDI. These resitors allow for the signal to be pulled back up after it drops for the reading between the two boards communicating with each other. The SCL and SDA allow for the boards to communicate quickly with one another with multiple lines of code and commands. I found success once I opened the serial monitor and seen the information being posted as well as the line of code I added. The image and video below show my board networked with an arduino and communicating:</p>

	  <p>It felt really good to finish this exercise because I put a lot of time and effort into it. Furthermore, this was my last piece of work for the course. I finished my final project and everything else, and came back to this last. Tom was a huge help explaining to me how to do this process.</p>
